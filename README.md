# fish : Fabulously Irrespectuous SHell

fish is a student project, aiming to be a basic interactive shell for linux.


## Warnings

fish is really an IRRESPECTUOUS shell. Now that you're warned...


## Features

fish reads from standard input and send you the result of every command on standard output ( unless you redirect I/O ). Aside of that, fish also implements various features :

* **Internal commands** : change of directory, exiting, help.
* **External commands** : fish will execute any command you ask, provided he can find those in his PATH variable.
* **Insults** : fish will yell at you whenever you make a mistake to make sure you never fail again.
* **Configuration file** : .fishrc file for easy configuration ( path, prompt.. ).
* **Globbing** : fish implements a globbing feature, handling characters such as \*, ? and ( soon ) ~.
* **Operators** : fish comes with some operators support : **&&** and **||**. 
* **I/O redirections** : coming soon ( TM )


everything without a single memory leak ! ( if you find one tell us )
